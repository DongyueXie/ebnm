Title: Fit Empirical Bayes Normal Means Model
Version: 0.1.2
Author: Matthew Stephens
Maintainer: <mstephens@uchicago.edu>
Description: Provides functions to fit the normal means problem using Empirical Bayes.
    The goal is for these functions to be simple, fast and stable. 
    Currently two models are implemented: the point-normal and point-laplace priors.
    The point-normal is considerably faster. See functions `ebnm_point_normal`, `ebnm_point_laplace`.
