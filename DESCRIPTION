Title: Fit Empirical Bayes Normal Means Model
Author: Matthew Stephens
Maintainer: Matthew Stephens <mstephens@uchicago.edu>
Description: Provides functions to fit the normal means problem using
    Empirical Bayes. The goal is for these functions to be simple,
    fast and stable. Currently two models are implemented: the
    point-normal and point-laplace priors. The point-normal is
    considerably faster. See functions ebnm_point_normal,
    ebnm_point_laplace.
